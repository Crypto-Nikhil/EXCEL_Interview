ðŸš€ Test project / Proof of Concept for an **AI-driven Excel Interview Assistant**.

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
As per the assignment brief:

> Manual Excel technical interviews are a bottleneck â€” they consume senior analystsâ€™ time, are inconsistent, and slow down the hiring process. An **AI-powered interviewer** can solve this by simulating interviews, evaluating answers, and providing feedback automatically.

## ðŸ”¹ Functionality
âœ… Structured Interview Flow  
- Introduces itself, explains the process, and walks through multiple Excel questions.  

âœ… Two Interview Modes  
- **Interview Mode** â†’ Candidate answers all questions, feedback given at the end.  
- **Practice Mode** â†’ Immediate feedback after each answer, with option to proceed to next question.  

âœ… Intelligent Evaluation  
- Uses **LLaMA 3.1 Instruct models** (via Hugging Face Inference API).  
- Candidate responses are parsed and evaluated on correctness, score, rationale, and suggested improvements.  

âœ… Feedback & Report  
- At the end, the system generates a **performance summary** with strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations.  
- Transcript and scores are stored as JSON for analysis.

## ðŸ”¹ Problems Solved
- **Removes bottleneck** in manual Excel interviews.  
- **Standardizes evaluation**, making hiring fair and consistent.  
- **Saves time** for senior analysts by automating first-round skill checks.  
- **Improves candidate experience** with clear, constructive feedback.

- ðŸ”¹ **Larger Question Bank** â†’ Expand beyond basic Excel to cover advanced use cases (PivotTables, VBA, Power Query).  
- ðŸ”¹ **Adaptive Interviewing** â†’ Questions chosen dynamically based on candidate performance.  
- ðŸ”¹ **Analytics Dashboard** â†’ For recruiters to compare candidates across attempts.
